# UE_GitWorkshop (UE5.6)

This project is part of the **Git for Unreal Engine Developers Workshop**.  
It demonstrates how to set up a clean and professional Git repository for Unreal Engine projects, including:

- Proper `.gitignore` rules for Unreal projects  
- Correct `.gitattributes` for text normalization and Git LFS integration  
- Git LFS tracking for binary assets (`.uasset`, `.umap`, `.fbx`, `.wav`, etc.)  
- Conventional Commit messages and trunk-based development workflow  

The Unreal project itself is created on the Windows host, while all Git operations are performed using a Linux-based Docker environment for consistency and reliability.
